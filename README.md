My implementation of test-task for Streem.

[Link to demo](https://streem-test.netlify.app)

I used the React-boiletplate as a starting template. I used Redux for managing application state and Saga for processing side-effects. 
All required routes were configured. 
From the home page you can go to a users page. 
Users info is fetched from the Api and is displayed on that page.
By Clicking on a user you can go to a user page. Information about the user and posts of the selected user will be fetched from Api and displayed.
By Clicking on a post you can go to the page of a current post with detailed information about it.
Continuous deployment is configured as well using Netlify.
